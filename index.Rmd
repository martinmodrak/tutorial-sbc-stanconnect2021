## Preparing for the tutorial

You will need to be able to compile and run Stan models from R/Rstudio via either `rstan` or `cmdstanr`. If you are not already an R user, we recommend using RStudio + `cmdstanr`. A good guide to install RStudio is at https://moderndive.netlify.app/1-getting-started.html and installing cmdstanr is described at
https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html 
If you encounter any problems during installation, please ask for help at https://discourse.mc-stan.org/

To let you work quickly through the exercises, we recommend running our setup script that
makes sure you have installed all you need and precompiles all models used in the exercises. You can run it via

```r
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martinmodrak/tutorial-sbc-stanconnect2021/main/setup_script.R")
```

If you don't want to use the setup script you'll need to at least install the new SBC package. 
To install it, you'll need the remotes package first:

```r
install.package("remotes")
```

Then you can install SBC via

```r
remotes::install_github("hyunjimoon/SBC")
```

- [Concluding remarks](conclusion.html)


## Poster on SBC & algorithms

Phil Clemson made a neat poster on using SBC for testing _algorithms_ once we have
a simulator and model we trust (unlike the tutorial which focuses on testing a model when we have an algorithm and a simulator we trust).
