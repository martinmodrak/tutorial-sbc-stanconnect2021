# Context

--

- SBC can be a useful tool to check you implemented your model correctly.

--

- It just one of tools to validate your model in a Bayesian workflow

--

- SBC can be run even before you collect data

--

- The goal of this tutorial is to show you that with the `SBC` package,
there is little cost to including (some form of) SBC in your everyday modelling workflow.

--

- In this tutorial, we'll let you use SBC to find and diagnose a bug.

--

- We will show toy problems, but have applied it to non-toy problems as well.

---

# Two types of problems with Stan model

1. Bug in model 

--

2. Data - model mismatch 

--

We will focus on 1.

---

# Result of SBC (1)

### SBC fails: There is a mismatch between our model, algorithm and simulator.

```{r}
set.seed(216456)

max_rank <- 100
N_ranks <- 200

rank_dfs <- list(
  data.frame(parameter = "beta", dataset_id = 1:N_ranks, rank = round(rbeta(N_ranks, shape1 = 0.8, shape2 = 1.2) * max_rank)),
  data.frame(parameter = "beta", dataset_id = 1:N_ranks, rank = round(rbeta(N_ranks, shape1 = 1, shape2 = 1) * max_rank))
)

plot_ecdf_diff(rank_dfs[[1]], max_rank = max_rank)
```


--

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mismatch can be anywhere!

---

# Result of SBC (2)


### SBC passes: To the precision availabe with the given number of simulations, our model, algorithm and simulator are consistent.

```{r}
plot_ecdf_diff(rank_dfs[[2]], max_rank = max_rank)
```


--

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a specific sense of consistent. Nothing more, nothing less.
