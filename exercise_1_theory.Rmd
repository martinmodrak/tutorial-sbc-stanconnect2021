# How this tutorial will work

(hopefully)

- Exercise
  - Tasks + questions
  - Bonuses
  - Materials will be available after the tutorial, so you can finish bonuses later.
- Stuck? First ask your colleagues at the table.
  - If you're still stuck, let know any of the organizers.
- It's for you! You can:
  - Mute everything and work alone
  - Take your time
  - Rush through everything
  - Wing it and wait for others to complete and tell you how it went.

CoC, moderation
